# OpenDKP Discord Bot

This is an example C# Discord Bot which implements some basic commands and demonstrates making a GET request to the Summary DKP information. The only thing you'll need to do is update the discord bot's DKP_URL and ClientId variables in the DKPService class.

DKP_URL only needs to be updated if you are NOT using OpenDKP AWS (monthly or annual subscription)

ClientId needs to be updated for your specific client, you'll find additional comments in the DKPService class file

## Disclaimer
Please do not leverage the source code you find in this repository as a standard or best practice. This was primarily a learning experience for integration into AWS and the overall design is piece meal over a long period of time. Given the opportunity to rebuild, as many engineers would say, I'd do things totally different!

Much refactoring is needed and any contributions are much appreciated

## Usage
You'll need to review the Discord Bot documentation for implementation and usage, this should work directly out of the box simply by updating the DKP_URL and ClientId variables

## Documentation
Documentation will be developed and provided over time.
